    "MOCAP sequences labeled as navigation realizations were taken from the CMU mocap database in order to build a training and validation set. Specifically the subject #41 was used with the trails ['04', '05'] for training and trials '06' for validation. These trials were chosen because they seemed to exhibit a diversity of walking behaviors-walking forward and backwards, diagonal etc. Onlye these three movements were considered because they were made up of pretty much the same underlying behaviors. The outputs of interest are both tibias and both radiuses as in the walking experiment. For more details see `mocap_extraction_script.py`. Note that movement realizations were normalized to vary in the range from [-1,1]."
